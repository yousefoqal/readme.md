### Executive Summary
In this unit of IT1025 you will learn about the types of software. You will learn on Python and how to do it. You will learn what is virtualization and cloud computing and how its applied. YOu will also learn how to aplly for internships and where to find interships.


### Software
Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web. Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer.The operating system manages the hardware and create the interface bwtween the hardware and the user. AN example of a utility software include anti-malware software and programs that totally remove software you no longer want installed. Examples of application software are word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or going on the Internet using any browser. The three most common examles of operating systems are microsoft window, Apple, and Linux. 
The Enterprise resource Planning (ERP) system was developed to bring together an entire organization within one program. ERP software utilizes a central database that is implemented throughout the entire organization. Examples of an ERP system are Oracle cloud ERP, Microsoft Dynamics, and SAP ERP.

### Virtualization 
Many problems could be solved using virtualization. The first problem that Virtualization solved was companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. The second problem that was solved was the servers were being used more efficiently so therefore reducing the costs that came with purchase, set up, cooling, and maintenance. The hypervisors separate the phyiscal resourcres from the virtual environment. Hypervisors can either sit on top of a computer or be plugged in to the hardware.
The key differences between cloud computing and virtualization. Virtualization is a technology that lets you make multiple simulated environments and also makes dedicated resources from a single physical hardware. The cloud are IT environments that are abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. An easier way of expaling them apart are Virtualization is teachonlogy and cloud is an environment. Clouds are used to enable cloud computing which acts to run workloads inside of the system.
Network administrator can use virtual resources that can be allocated and become into a cloud. 

### Python
the Pseudo-code nature of python is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorith. 
What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language? Compiled language is written as C or C++. Interpreted language takes the C or C++ and interprets into into binary code so the computer can understand it.

### Career Exploration 
#### Career Central
College central is a great website to find jobs near you for your major. It has a career portfolio to help you keep track of the jobs you can get.

It tells you how much the median pay for the career is. Overall its a great website if your confused about your careeer or you want to know more about the career that your interested in.
#### Certifications 
CompTIA is the only cybersecurity analyst certification with both hands-on, performance based questions and multiplechoice questions. The CompTIA tests  the candidates ability capture, monitor, and respond to network traffic findings, but also software and application security, automation, threat hunting, and IT regulatory compliance. The CompTIA exam is approved by the U.S department of defense. The test helps improve people skills on how to remove malware and other threats that can hurt the system.
#### Certificate
Im reporting my finding on the cybersecurity post degree professional certificate. You have to take 7 courses to obtain the certificate for Cybersecurity. You need 27 credit hours to get the certificate. The program helps students apply principles ecurity to install, configure, maintain, and secure business operations. Program will help you understand and apply legal, privacy and ethical concepts.
#### Co-ops / Internships
Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center. Upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake.
Work with an Employer Relations Specialist to apply and interview with approved co-op placements. Complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form and register for college credit. The benefits of doing a co-op/ internship you can feel out the caeer you want to enter. So if your majoring in Cybersecurity you can go to a firm and see other people in the feild and see what they do on a day to day basis.
#### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
The CCDC mission is to provide institutions with information assurance or computer security curriculum. They also test the student in a competitive Environment to test there understanding.  The beneifts of going to the CCDC it gives you a higher understanding of Cybersecurity. The CCDC also holds competitions for its students to assume administrative and protective duites to an existing commercial network. Another beneifit is you get to mmeet people from many different parts of the US and build a team together.

### Summary
This Unit taught me alot of things about IT it showed me the differnt types of computer software. Exaplained the differneces of virtualization and cloud computing and also how they can be used together. It gave me a brief introduction about python and how to use it. You also learned how to out in the commands for the python how to make it say my name is. The career central gave me a better understanding about the it jobs there are near me and the qualifications you need to get a job.
