### Executive Summary


### Software
Application software performs specific tasks such as word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web. Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer.The operating system manages the hardware and create the interface bwtween the hardware and the user. AN example of a utility software include anti-malware software and programs that totally remove software you no longer want installed. Examples of application software are word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or going on the Internet using any browser.

###Virtualization 
Many problems could be solved using virtualization. The first problem that Virtualization solved was companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. The second problem that was solved was the servers were being used more efficiently so therefore reducing the costs that came with purchase, set up, cooling, and maintenance. The hypervisors separate the phyiscal resourcres from the virtual environment. Hypervisors can either sit on top of a computer or be plugged in to the hardware.
The key differences between cloud computing and virtualization. Virtualization is a technology that lets you make multiple simulated environments and also makes dedicated resources from a single physical hardware. The cloud are IT environments that are abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. An easier way of expaling them apart are Virtualization is teachonlogy and cloud is an environment. Clouds are used to enable cloud computing which acts to run workloads inside of the system.
Network administrator can use virtual resources that can be allocated and become into a cloud. 

###Python
the Pseudo-code nature of python is a term which is often used in programming and algorithm based fields. It is a methodology that allows the programmer to represent the implementation of an algorith. 
What is an interpreted language vs. a compiled language? Compiled language is written as C or C++. Interpreted language takes the C or C++ and interprets into into binary code so the computer can understand it.
